I am interested in:
- Multimodality (e.g.  vision-language)
- Online Video-LLMs

Previously worked on:
- Video-Language Modelling
- Spatio-temporal action detection
- Weakly/Semi-supervised learning for video action detection
- 3D digital representations and scene understanding (SfM, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting)
- 6DoF pose estimation
- AR/VR/MR/XR
- Computer graphics for synthetic data
